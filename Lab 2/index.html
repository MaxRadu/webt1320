        <h2>Favorite Game Of Thrones Character</h2>
        <h3>"Jon Snow is my favorite character."</h3>
        <h4> Here are some of my thoughts</h4>

        <p>Jon Snow is my favorite character from the show because of how much he changes throughout the seasons. Starting out, he's already pretty smart but definitely a little naive and unsure of himself. He's made fun of because he's not highborn and a bastard of Ned Stark, as far as we know. To do some soul searching and to prove himself he decides to join the Crows of the Night's Watch at the wall. Eventully he goes beyond the wall with a group of Crows to find the Wildlings and get answers about the White Walkers. </p>

        <p>All throughout the show until roughly season 6, people struggle to believe in him and see him as reckless. It's not until the Battle Of Castle Black that he gains the true support of nearly all the Crows. He's also my favorite character because of how much he believes in his best friend Samwell Tarly. Sam is even more unsure of himself than Jon when they first meet and can't even bring himself to fight. Jon sees bits of himself in Sam and chooses to stand up for him and eventually helps Sam find his true calling. </p>
