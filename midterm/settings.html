    <h2 style="font-family:Verdana;">The world of The Last Of Us is filled with many extremely dangerous people and creatures.</h2>
    <br>

        <h2 style="font-family:Verdana;">There are four stages of infected: Runners, Stalkers, Clickers, and Bloaters.</h2>
    <br>
        <p style="font-family:Verdana;">Runners can still somewhat see and will chase you down and will attack you on sight. Stalkers are partially blind and will hide in the shadows to find opportunities to attack. Clickers are completely blind due to a thick fungus that covers their face, but have a very heightened sense of hearing and click their mouthes to use a sort of echolocation to seek you out. While you can fight Runners and Stalkers with your fists or melee weapons, Clickers can only be killed with fire, bullets, arrows or explosives. Bloaters are the result of being infected for a very long time and have extremely thick fungal armor around their entire body; they are very strong, physically imposing, have spore bombs they can throw at you and can take a huge beating before they are killed.  </p>

        <p style="font-family:Verdana;">On the other end of the spectrum are human enemies such as hunters, fireflies, and the military. Hunters are people who are only in it to kill and loot other surivors and will atack on sight. Fireflies have nearly the same gear as the military but won't initally attack on sight and really need a good reason to do so. They are mostly morally good people and their main goal is to find a cure to the Cordyceps virus. The military, as it seems to go in most post-apocalyptic settings, are not people you want to trust or be around. They kill anyone who is infected, have the best gear out of any group, and are mainly focused on keeping people in poorly supplied and oppressive quarantine zones. To successfully survive in this world you will need all manner of firearms ranging from: revolvers, semiautomatic pistols, shotguns, sniper rifles, and even bows and arrows. Against the infected, especially with large numbers, molotov cocktails and explosives will be you best options. Lastly don't be afraid to get creative and use what might be lying around such as: pipes, 2x4s or knives and taping sharp objects to the ends of those can help greatly in your favor.
