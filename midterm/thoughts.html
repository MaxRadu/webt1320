        <h1 style="font-family:Verdana;">So... this everything you were hopin' for?</h1>

        <p style="font-family:Verdana;">I purposely shortened my description of the game in the story section because this is not a game that can be described easily. At least no words will ever be able to match how powerful the storytelling is in this game, beautifully brought to life by the actors and actresses who portrayed these complex characters. The overall plot is simple, just get this girl to people who could potentially save humanity and shoot a bunch of things on the way. But something it manages to do so well is visually and emotionally portray meaningful character growth. One of the best aspects of this game is how few characters are present throughout the entire runtime making it easier to connect to them. You don't have to juggle 20-30 different characters around like in The Walking Dead, sometimes you don't need that. Simplicity is what can lead to a great story, the characters are relatable enough, interesting enough, have moments of sadness, moments of happiness, and moments of regret. They are about as human as characters in a video game can get. I hope you get a chance to play this game one day and understand why I'm gushing so much. But anyway this was a brief look into the world and the characters of The Last Of Us.  </p>
