            <h1>Welcome to Tamriel, tread carefully.</h1>
            <p>To survive these lands, one must be prepared in the ways of magic, the sword, and the mind. Knowing who to trust will be key to your survival, pick the wrong person, and your journey will be a swift one. However one doesn't have to confide in the help of others if they are cunning enough or rich enough. With enough gold, nearly any conversation can go your way. But with a sharp silver tongue, not only will you be the master of the spoken word but the respect you will gain will be tenfold. </p>

            <h2>Many destinations</h2>
            <p>The real question is, "Where will your journey begin?" The cold mystical lands of Skyrim with its snow caked mountains that scrape the sky with their sharp pointed tips? How about Morrow wind? A swampy land filled with creatures of scales and poisoned appendages. The red piercing eyes of the Dunmer hide secrets not so easily revealed, a land where you must truly have allies or it will swallow you whole. Or will you settle for somewhere warm, green, and blue. Somewhere whose air is so crisp it refreshes your lungs with every gasp. The sun places its soft gaze on your shoulders and the vistas beckon for your adventurous wonder.
