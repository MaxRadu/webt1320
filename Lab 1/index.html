        <h1>VFX</h1>
        <p>I've always been interested and amazed by the world of visual effects throughout my adolescence and now adult life. Seeing the behind the scenes of computer generated and practical effects is so cool watching the processes creators use to create their ideas is inspiring.
        My dream job would be to work for some kind of visual effects studio, regardless of whether it's for big budget films or smaller films, I hope to create memorable moments for people to enjoy and be fascinated by.
        Hopefully once I recieve my bachelors in computer animation I'll be able to create effects like these and work together with other creators to build projects that are visually stunning and keep people coming back for more.
